# Starbucks Capstone Project
This project is analyses the customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app to optimize the offers given to the users.
It is the source for my blogpost [Selling Coffee like a Data Scientist](https://medium.com/@martin_47009/selling-coffee-like-a-data-scientist-e54221b06330).

## Getting started
You can find further explanation of the data in `Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb` or as static HTML-file in `Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.html`.
For this project following additional packages to `python3` are required:
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`

In `data` you find the data for the project as described in the notebook. Note that data comes from Udacity/Starbucks and they might have rights on it.

Have fun!
